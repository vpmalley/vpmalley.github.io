Shelters in Quebec, Canada, along the trans-Canada trail.

I could not find a centralised list of all community shelters in Quebec. However, I could list some organisations that manage shelters and list some of those along [a small portion of the Trans-Canada trail (Sentier National in Quebec)][mata-s], from Mont-Tremblant to the reserve Mastigouche. I list them in the order West-East.

For each shelter, I try to list the following:

 - [name] - [capacity] - [price per night per person] - [location(optional)] - [access from previous shelter] - [opening period]

## Sepaq

The [Sepaq][sepaq] manages many provincial parks (called national parks) and the Trans-Canada trail crosses them in multiple places. The Sepaq operates shelters all over Quebec in its parks of Fjord-du-Saguenay, Gaspésie, Grands-Jardins, Mont-Mégantic, Mont-Orford, Mont-Tremblant, Monts-Valin and Yamaska.

### in Mont-Tremblant national park

- Lac-Ernie - 18 people - ~25$ - access from Lac Monroe Park center : ~13km - open May-March
- Lac-des-Sables - 18 people - ~25$ - access from Lac-Ernie : 9.5km - open May-March
- Le Lariou - 2 people - ~25$ - access from Lac-des-Sables : ~10km - open May-March
- Le Geai-Bleu - 4 people - ~25$ - access from Le Lariou : ~5km, from La Pimbinia Park entrance : few km - open May-March

This is an alternative way to link Mont-Tremblant and St-Donnat, the Trans-Canada trail follows the Intercentre trail (see below).

## Intercentre

The ["Intercentre" trail][icentre] links Lac-Laurier and St-Donat, and is a part of the trans-Canada trail.

- [Le Nordet][icentre-s] - 8 people - 22$ - N 46° 14' 10", W 74° 23' 55.2" - [access from parking on the chemin du Nordet : 6.5km][icentre-t] (north of Lac-Supérieur) - open year-round
- [Le Lac de l'Appel][icentre-s] - 8 people - 22$ - N 46° 15' 57.2", W 74° 21' 14.8" - [access from Le Nordet: 6.7km, to chemin Regimbald : ~15km][icentre-t] - open year-round

From the chemin Regimbald, it is possible to reach highway 329 and from there follow the chemin Wall to continue on the Mont-Ouareau trail.

## FQMarche (Quebec Federation of Hiking)

The [FQMarche][fqm] manages two shelters, both along the Trans-Canada trail, one in the area of Mont-Ouareau:

- [Paul Perreault][fqm-s-pp] - 12 people - 10-15$ - near Lac Lemieux - [hwy 329 : 4-6km, hwy 125 : 8.5km][fqm-s-pp-map] - open year-round

The Trans-Canada trail is discontinued along the highway 125, it starts farther on the Massif trail in the regional park of the Ouareau forest.

## Parc Régional de la Forêt Ouareau

I could not find a mention of when the shelters are open, but it seems they are operated in summer and winter. They all appear on the [map of the Massif trail][ouareau-s-map]

 - Pelletier - 8 people - 30,25$ - near Lac à Pelletier - ~3km from hwy 125, near Notre-Dame de la Merci
 - Prud'homme - 8 people - 30,25$ - 2.5km from Pelletier shelter
 - La Loutre - 2 people - 30,25$ - 2km from trans-Canada trail
 - Corbeau - 6 people - 30,25$ - 2km from trans-Canada trail
 - Toussaint - 8 people - 30,25$ - 16.5km from Prud'homme shelter
 - des Capucines - 6 people - 30,25$ - 4km from Toussaint shelter

Then the trail continues without any shelter (but some lean-to) on the [Contreforts][mata-s-map3] and the Swaggin trails.

## Parcs Régionaux Matawinie - Sentier National

I could not find a mention of when the shelters are open, but it seems they are operated in summer and winter.

- Swaggin - 20 people - 25$ - the previous shelter on the trans-Canada trail is on the Massif trail, 38km away (refuge des Capucines)
- Lavigne - 8 people - 25$ - [6.5km from Swaggin shelter on La Boule trail][mata-s-map1]
- Lac Boule - 8 people - 25$ - near Lac de la Boule - [10km from Lavigne shelter on La Boule trail][mata-s-map1]
- Bazinet - 8 people - 25$ - near Lac des Iles - [~11km from Lac Boule shelter, on Perces-Brumes trail][mata-s-map2]

The trans-Canada trail continues on several successive trails (Ours, Matawinie, Nymphes, Mistikush) without any appareent shelter on the way (see the [Cartes tab of Matawinie page for the trans-Canada trail for maps of these trails][mata]).

## FQMarche (Quebec Federation of Hiking)

A second shelter managed by the FQMarche is at the end of Mistikush trail:

- [Grand-Masti][fqm-s-gm] - 6 people - 10-15$ - near Morin Creek - [parking in ZEC des Nymphes : ~14km through Nymphes and Mistikush trails][fqm-s-gm-map], [~15km along Cheriore trail to a parking near Petit William cabin (not bookable for only one person)][fqm-s-gm-map1] - open in summer (May 17 to Sep 1st)

Then the Trans-Canada trail arrives in the [reserve Mastigouche][masti-map], with no shelter open to single-person reservation.

<br>

This list of shelters along the Trans-Canada trail in Quebec is definitely incomplete as the trail is particularly long (1100km) but I hope to enrich it with time.

## SIA-IAT (International Appalachian Trail)

The [International Appalachian Trail][iat] group manages a set of shelters, not along the trans-Canada trail but still worth noting. They publish [a list of their shelters][iat-s]. I do not list them as they are not along the Trans-Canada trail but along the Quebec section of the International Appalachian Trail.
